                        My love of problem solving and logic comes from a very young age. I grew up in a family that had video games accessible from the time I was born. My grandfather would spend hours with me playing games and he never went easy on me, meaning I had to overcome obstacles that required thought and preparation. Applying this to more educational pursuits started in 8th grade when I was assigned a teacher that showed me how exciting and fun math can be and that lead me down the path to becoming a future programmer.

                        I attended The University of Whitewater initially attempting to become a civil engineer but a few years in I decided to try my hand at the arts. I switched majors to Theatre with an emphasis on performance. I graduated with a BFA in this field. Even though I have decided not to pursue this field, I believe that the emphasis on team work is invaluable and taught me how to work with all different kinds of people from each area and come together to present something we are proud of.

                        After graduating I took the job I currently have at the University as a custodian. It was while working here that I discovered a game called dreams. This is a game making game that allows the user to create their own games and it absolutely hooked me. I once spent an entire Saturday from the time I woke up to the time I went to bed watching tutorial after tutorial learning how to make my own game. I eventually made my own little game that worked how I wanted and looked the way I wanted. If you ask me about it, I would absolutely love to talk about it. Fast forward a couple months and I very proudly showed a friend of mine who works as a software engineer and he told me "Lance, you realize this is coding right?". I was shocked. It was drag and drop chip based programming that didn't require writing lines of code so it didn't even cross my mind. That very day I had him help me find a program that would teach me how to code. He graciously gifted to me his old PC when he got a new one and I enrolled into the University of Wisconsin extended campus full stack web development program.

                        <h3 className="about-body">
                        I started the program in August of 2022 shortly after getting married. I loved it. It was genuinely amazing and I was very happy to be learning something that seemed like the perfect fit. I enjoyed the people I worked with and creating something. It perfectly suited my want to create and my need to solve problems. Unfortunately, about three months into the program my father tragically passed away. I was distraught and I missed a couple weeks of class. This was a very fast moving program and I fell very behind. Trying to juggle a full time job and a boot camp that I had fallen behind in was a lot. But I persevered and I was able to pass. I graduated with a certificate in February of 2023.

                        I had not retained the information like I needed to though and began my journey of re teaching myself the entire course. Which I did! It took me a little over a year to do so to make sure I had really retained the information. Then I was ready to really practice. So I did. I now have two fullstack react websites under my belt that were more robust than anything I did in the program. Along the way I was able to learn even more than what was taught in the program and I am much more sure of myself now and ready to become a fulltime programmer.
